            <hr />
            <h3>The Terminal</h3>
            <p>One of my all time favorites. Not very well known, it's about a sweet story of a man getting stranded at an airport terminal.</p>
            <h3>Interstellar</h3>
            <p>A great space movie that is scientifically accurate, and has cool depictions of planets, space, and time.</p>
            <h3>Whiplash</h3>
            <p>Insane movie about a drummer who aims to please a never satisfied professor.</p>

<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi Welcome! I can't tell you how ecstatic I am that you are here. Now that you are, I suppose an introduction is in order.
  Well for starters my name is Christian, but I prefer to go by Jed which is my middle name. I am a Computer Science graudate 
  from California State University, Fullerton. I graduated in 2023 with a Major GPA of 3.67 and an Overall GPA of 3.27. During
  my educational journey I was able to obtain an internship with the company Sonarverse as a Data Engineer. After which I was
  able to obtain my current role as a Software Tester with the company FYI. My goals involve becoming a Web Developer for exciting 
  companies within Animation, Film, Sports or FAANG.

  Aside from my educational and professional aspects, I feel as though a personal description will help shed light on how I may
  fit into a companies environment. Beginning in Middle School, growing up in Southern California, I was one of those who became
  obsessed with Disney. From that point on I knew I have always loved the creative aspects of things and is what lead me to where
  I am today. Concurrently, I was also obsessed with playing sports, Basketball being my main interest. I never would have thought
  I would have graduated in a major that was mathematical or analytical. Out of High School I attended an art school but realized
  my skills were not up to par with my classmates. I knew I had to find a new direction to get to where I wanted to be, hence 
  Computer Science.

  My journey made it so that it took approximately 8 years to graduate. During that time I definitely believe it was not a waste
  of my efforts. Sure it would have been nice to have graduate on time and receive a job offer soon after, but the experiences
  I had would have been lost. I was a barista for most of my time, and I was even able to land a job in Disneyland as a barista
  at Starbucks. This then lead me to find some of my bestest friends which would lead me to great adventures. As much as I wanted 
  to move out of my home, I'm starting to look at everything I have as a blessing. Things have definitely changed for me, but I 
  know that if I keep on tredging forward I'll have that nice high rise apartment in DTLA near the Crypto.com Arena with a nice
  paying job and beautiful work space for coding overlooking the city!
